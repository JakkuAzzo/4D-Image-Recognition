## Detailed Findings

### Watermarking
Current integration exposes watermark confidence only when bitstring provided. Implementation is present but lacks a dedicated robustness evaluation harness (e.g., BER under Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, scaling). Confidence is mapped linearly (1-BER) which is intuitive but could be augmented with confidence intervals or a statistical reliability score.

Recommended next steps:
1. Create `tests/test_watermark_robustness.py` generating variants (noise, rotate, crop) and computing BER distribution.
2. Add PSNR/SSIM metrics for transformed images to correlate perceptual quality with BER.
3. Establish a baseline BER table and drift check (similar to phash AUC).

### Perceptual Fingerprinting & ROC Calibration
pHash implementation includes multi-scale hashing and threshold calibration plus ROC/AUC artifact generation (JSON, CSV, optional PNG). AUC drift guard ensures regressions surface quickly. New regression test covers similarity stability for mild transforms.

Recommended enhancements:
- Add compression (JPEG quality sweep) and blur tests.
- Persist distribution snapshots (histogram JSON) for deeper forensic comparison when drift occurs.
- Introduce multi-scale weighting experimentation in fusion (e.g., separate weight per scale cluster).

### Semantic Component
Optional; gracefully absent if embedding backend unavailable. Current tests skip when CLIP not loadedâ€”adequate for CI resilience but lacks quality measurement.

Recommendations:
- Record embedding dimensionality & model identifier in fusion outputs.
- Add semantic similarity calibration (positive/negative pairs) with its own ROC.
- Provide caching / batching for performance under multiple queries.

### Provenance Ledger
Ledger integrity reduces to boolean; included in fusion as a binary confidence. No tamper simulation tests yet.

Recommendations:
1. Add `tests/test_ledger_tamper.py` altering a record mid-chain to assert detection.
2. Add timing and size scaling benchmarks (N records) to profile performance.
3. Consider cryptographic agility (algorithm abstraction for future upgrades).

### Fusion Engine
Weighted geometric mean design penalizes weak links, matching provenance risk aggregation philosophy. Weight & threshold CLI + programmatic overrides now documented. Tests validate override and core math.

Future improvements:
- Auto adjust weights based on recent component variance / reliability (adaptive fusion).
- Provide per-component sensitivity analysis (delta score per unit change).
- Add JSON schema versioning for fusion artifacts.

### Drift & Trends
Drift detection currently limited to pHash AUC. Infrastructure can generalize to other metrics (watermark BER median, ledger anomaly rate, semantic ROC). Weekly trend aggregation lays foundation for anomaly detection.

Next steps:
- Introduce multi-metric drift JSON with per-metric max deltas and aggregated alert flag.
- Visualize trends (matplotlib PNG) for quick inspection.

### Testing & Quality
Added direct `fuse()` tests, weight override tests, semantic inclusion (conditional), and pHash transform regression. Coverage is improving but watermark & ledger remain light.

Suggestions:
- Add coverage badge & test matrix summary in README.
- Incorporate mutation testing (e.g., mutmut) for critical cryptographic & hashing functions.

### Privacy
Ephemeral storage / encryption claims require explicit automated assertions.

Actionable items:
- Implement a context-managed temp artifact writer with auto-clean tests.
- If encryption in transit/at rest is claimed, add key management & decryption tests.

## Prioritized Backlog (Technical Alignment)
1. Watermark robustness test suite + BER baseline artifacts.
2. Ledger tamper & performance tests.
3. Multi-metric drift guard (extend existing framework).
4. Semantic calibration + model version metadata in outputs.
5. Adaptive fusion weight prototype + explanation layer.
6. Privacy enforcement tests (ephemeral deletion, encryption verification).
7. Compression & blur robustness for pHash.

## Evidence Checklist
- Calibration: `phash_threshold.json`, `phash_roc.csv`, (PNG optional).
- Drift: `phash_auc_drift.json` with note & alert flag.
- Fusion: `fusion_report.json`, historical `fusion_history.csv` + summary.
- Tests: Weight override (`test_fusion_weights.py`), core math (`test_fusion_core.py`), semantic inclusion (`test_semantic_component.py`), pHash robustness (`test_phash_regression.py`).

## Conclusion
Core claims (multi-signal provenance, calibrated perceptual hashing, ledger integrity incorporation, configurable fusion, drift monitoring) are substantively implemented with observable artifacts. Remaining work focuses on deepening robustness evaluation (watermark, ledger), expanding drift coverage, formalizing privacy guarantees, and enhancing semantic & adaptive capabilities. Executing the prioritized backlog will elevate the system from functional prototype to a rigorously validated research artifact suitable for scholarly dissemination.
