- tests/OSINT_URLS_20250725_165826/URL_TEST_SUMMARY_20250725_165826.txt
- tests/OSINT_URLS_20250725_163338/VERIFICATION_SUMMARY_20250725_163338.txt
- backend/api.py (OSINT endpoints wiring)
- tests/*osint* (test harnesses, mock fallbacks)
- Multiple “final reports” in repo are empty placeholders (e.g., GENUINE_OSINT_SUCCESS_REPORT.md, OSINT_INVESTIGATION_FINAL_REPORT.md)

## Key findings

- Discovery vs verification mismatch:
  - Claimed discovered URLs: 12 (osint_summary_20250724_021300.txt)
  - Direct URL reachability: 2/12 accessible (16.7%)
  - Of the 2 “accessible”:
    - LinkedIn opened a generic sign-up/privacy page (no verified target profile)
    - arXiv returned an “identifier not recognized” page (non-article)
  - Net effect: 0/12 appear to be verified, target-specific matches.

- Error modes observed in direct verification (10/12): generic 404 or “page not found” across Facebook, Instagram, X, GitHub, Stack Overflow, TechCrunch, WIRED, SFGate, IEEE Xplore, podcasts.

- Confidence inflation: osint_summary reports Overall Confidence = 1.00 with 100% face detection. These do not align with verification outcomes and suggest confidence scores are not gated by verification.

- Synthetic patterns: Several URLs include truncated or hash-like tokens (e.g., osint_ha, sh_40276, 14052366, hash_4) indicative of heuristics or placeholders rather than resolved entities.

- Test harnesses include mock fallbacks: Many tests generate mock OSINT results when endpoints are unavailable, which can mask real-world failures and produce “passing” test runs without verified intelligence.

## Metrics snapshot

- URL discovery: 12
- URL reachability: 2/12 (16.7%)
- Verified entity/page matches: 0/12 (≈0%)
- False positive rate (at URL level): ≈100%
- Evidence strength: Weak — no reproduced page content ties conclusively to the subject; accessible pages are generic.

## Root cause hypotheses

1) Generation heuristics create plausible-but-fake URLs without post-resolution validation.
2) Domain-specific validators are missing (e.g., selectors for LinkedIn profiles, GitHub users, press articles).
3) Confidence scoring isn’t conditioned on verification (HTTP 200 + content match), leading to inflated scores.
4) Mock-result fallbacks in tests conflate internal success with external OSINT validity.

## Recommendations (actionable)

- Add a verification stage and gate confidence:
  - Require HTTP 200 OK, followed by domain-specific content assertions (e.g., profile header, username slug, semantic cues). Lower confidence on redirects/captchas/consent walls.
  - Track status per URL: {resolved, http_status, verified: boolean, reason}.

- Implement domain adapters with semantic checks:
  - LinkedIn: detect profile pages (header intro-card-selector), extract canonical profile ID.
  - GitHub: require user profile JSON via HTML scraping or API when available; validate username match.
  - News: validate headline presence, byline, and body length; ensure non-404 template pages.
  - Academic: arXiv/IEEE — validate valid identifiers and titles.

- Strengthen entity resolution:
  - Move from synthetic handles to search-driven discovery (site: queries + name/face context where policy-compliant).
  - Use reverse image search engines that permit automated usage; otherwise, guide operator-assisted workflows.

- Tighter scoring and provenance:
  - Score = discovery_score × reachability × content_match × freshness × source_reliability.
  - Persist per-URL evidence artifacts (timestamped HTML snapshots, normalized text, selector hits). Save to data/results/.

- Testing and quality gates:
  - Update tests to fail when verified matches == 0 or when >50% URLs are 404.
  - Remove/mock fallbacks from “success” paths; reserve mocks for isolated unit tests only.
  - Add an integration test that reads discovered URLs and performs live verification with domain adapters.

- Reporting improvements:
  - Generate a single consolidated JSON: verified_osint_report.json with per-URL fields:
    - {source, url, http_status, verified, verification_method, confidence, evidence_path}
  - Markdown summary with real precision/recall where possible, and a list of verified, actionable items.

## Proposed acceptance criteria (minimum)

- ≥3 verified, actionable URLs per subject in a standard test run, or explicit “no matches” with zero false positives.
- URL verification pass rate ≥70% on discovered set.
- Confidence scores reflect verification outcome (no ≥0.9 items without verification).
- No empty/placeholder “success” reports; artifacts contain non-empty, verifiable evidence.

## Notes

- Several headline reports in the repo are empty; treat them as placeholders and not evidence of OSINT success.
- DNS issues on the host do not explain OSINT false positives; direct browser tests reached hosts but pages were 404 or generic, indicating discovery quality is the main gap.
