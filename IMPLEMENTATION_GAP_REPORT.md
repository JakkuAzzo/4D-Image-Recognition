# Implementation Gap Report (Initial)

Generated: 2025-09-17

## Overview
This document maps dissertation-claimed architectural components to current repository implementation status following recent remediation steps.

| Component / Claim | Description (from dissertation) | Implementation Status | Notes / Next Actions |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Invisible Watermarking | Robust, imperceptible watermark in transform domain with quality metrics | Implemented (MVP) | `modules/watermarking.py` DCT sign/magnitude embedding; robustness harness pending |
| Perceptual Hashing / Fingerprinting | Multi-scale perceptual + semantic fingerprinting (pHash + CLIP) | Implemented (MVP) | `modules/perceptual_fingerprint.py` pHash + multi-scale; semantic embedding optional; add index + ROC eval later |
| Blockchain / Provenance Ledger | Append-only cryptographic provenance chain | Implemented (MVP) | `modules/ledger.py` HMAC chain ledger; add key rotation & Merkle batching future |
| 4D Biometric Reconstruction | 3D/4D facial mesh reconstruction & feature extraction | Partial | PRNet / DECAs integrated skeleton; full temporal fusion & error metrics lacking |
| Liveness / Anti-Spoof | Multi-modal liveness (blink, depth, texture) | Partial | `modules/liveness.py` simplistic; need temporal blink/depth cues & spoof classifier |
| Privacy-Preserving / Ephemeral Storage | Minimal retention, hashed identifiers, secure deletion | Missing / At-risk | Need data retention policy module, secure wipe, salted hashing of IDs |
| Evaluation Metrics Suite | Automated benchmarks (speed, accuracy, robustness) | Partial | Some pipeline tests exist; need unified metrics aggregator & visual diff harness |
| Visual Diff & UI Regression | Screenshot diffing & tolerance thresholds | Missing | Planned diff script + threshold & artifact manifest integration |
| Notification & CI Guardrails | Automated alerts on regression or integrity failure | Missing | Will add webhook/Slack script + lightweight GitHub workflow |
| Provenance + Watermark + Fingerprint Fusion | Cross-verification logic combining signals | Missing | Design fusion scoring + conflict resolution rules |
| Robustness Testing (Attacks) | Noise, compression, geometric transform resistance eval | Missing | Add robustness harness for watermark & pHash with report JSON |

## Recent Additions
- Watermarking module with PSNR/SSIM and noise robustness test.
- Perceptual fingerprint module (pHash, multiscale, optional semantic embedding, threshold calibration helper).
- Lightweight HMAC-chained ledger for provenance recording.
- Tests: watermark round-trip & noise robustness, perceptual hash stability, ledger tamper detection.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Privacy layer implementation (ephemeral file manager + hashed ID registry).
2. Visual diff pipeline & artifact schema.
3. Notification script & CI smoke workflow.
4. Fusion logic for watermark + fingerprint + ledger cross-check.
5. Robustness harness expansion (JPEG, scaling, rotation stress tests).

## Risk Assessment
- Privacy: High risk relative to claimsâ€”no concrete implementation yet.
- Robustness: Watermark & pHash not formally evaluated under transformations; risk of over-claiming.
- Liveness: Current simplistic approach inadequate for production anti-spoof claim.

## Suggested Metrics to Add
- Watermark Bit Error Rate (BER) under perturbation suite.
- pHash stability score (mean Hamming distance vs baseline across transforms).
- Ledger verification latency & chain length growth.
- Time-to-fingerprint (ms) and memory footprint.

## Next Steps (Planned Roadmap Extract)
- Implement `modules/privacy.py` for ephemeral handling.
- Add `scripts/visual_diff.py` & integrate into test artifacts.
- Create `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` for fast CI.
- Implement fusion scoring in `modules/signal_fusion.py`.
- Extend robustness harness and update this report.
