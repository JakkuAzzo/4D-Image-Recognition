üåê MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: https://localhost:8000
3. Accept the SSL certificate warning (click Advanced -> Proceed)
4. Take screenshots of each section:

üì∏ Screenshots to take:
   - Initial page load (full interface)
   - Upload area (file selection interface)
   - Processing pipeline (7-step workflow)
   - 3D visualization section
   - OSINT intelligence section
   - Export/download section

üîç Things to verify in each screenshot:
   - Section is visible and properly styled
   - Buttons and controls are present
   - Text is readable
   - Layout looks professional
   - No obvious errors or missing elements

üìã Test the following functionality:
   - Click file upload button
   - Select test images (use files in test_images/)
   - Start processing
   - Check if steps progress
   - Verify 3D visualization loads
   - Check OSINT data displays
   - Test export buttons

üí° Look for these specific issues:
   - Missing CSS styling (unstyled HTML)
   - Broken images or icons
   - JavaScript errors (check browser console)
   - Unresponsive buttons
   - Missing sections or content
   - Error messages

üìä After testing, document:
   - What works correctly
   - What shows errors
   - What's missing
   - Visual/styling issues
   - Functional problems
